Include sheet music on your WordPress site by simply specifying the ABC style string.

== Description ==

This includes the abcjs system on your WordPress site. To produce sheet music, put a valid ABC Notation string between the shortcodes [abcjs] and [/abcjs] on your page or post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload this folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Click 'Settings' in the dashboard, then 'ABC Notation' to customize.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can this be used? =

Anywhere that shortcodes are accepted. That is, on pages, post, and widgets. It will not work on comments.

= How does it work? =

The plugin includes the [abcjs](http://abcjs.net/) JavaScript library. The string that is put in the shortcode is passed to that library, which translates it and renders it in an SVG element that it places on the page instead of the shortcode.

= What can be put in the ABC string that is placed in the shortcode? =

There is much written about ABC Notation around the web. You can start [here](http://abcnotation.com)
